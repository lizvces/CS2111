# CS211

These are some of my assignments for the Computer Science 211 course at Rutgers University. These are all written in C and use various data structures to complete specific tasks.

PA1: The purpose of this assignment was to test our knowledge of data structures. Each subdirectory contains different tasks in which different data structures were needed to be implemented. 

PA2: A simple machine learning algorithm. Takes in a file with the attributes of a house as our training data. Based on the information, the algorithm will determine the weights of each attribute and determine the price of another house based on these weights.
